### Context: 
Modern information access systems promise to give citizens direct access to key information from authoritative primary sources. The scientific literature is involved but is in fact difficult to access for non-experts because of the complexity of the language, structure, length, etc., of scientific papers and the lack of scientific acculturation. The content of the scientific debate, which proceeds by comparing a multiplicity of studies before reaching a consensus, is also a source of complexity. Individual or political decisions are potentially affected by a lack of knowledge of the whole body of scientific work and debate.

This reading difficulty also exists when scientists are interested in scientific documents from disciplines in which they are not experts. Conflicting results within a discipline are difficult for non-specialists to understand. What about conflicting results between disciplines?

The aim of text simplification is to reduce these obstacles.

The SimpleText workshop will address the opportunities and challenges of scientific text simplification approaches to improve access to scientific information and scientific acculturation.

The SimpleText workshop will draw on an interdisciplinary community of researchers in automatic language processing, information retrieval, linguistics, sociology, science journalism, and popular science working together to address one of today's greatest challenges. The SimpleText workshop is part of the MaDICS research group ([Masses de Données, Informations et Connaissances en Sciences](https://www.madics.fr/ateliers/simpletext/)).

### Keywords: 
* Simplification and popularization of science
* Multi-document abstract
* Contextualization
* Automatic natural language processing
* Information retrieval

### Details of the submission format:
**Anonymous** submissions, in *French* or *English*, in PDF format only, should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inforsid2021) following the Hermès-Lavoisier template:
*	Word style sheet: [http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/feuilledeStyle_ARL.doc](http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/feuilledeStyle_ARL.doc)
* Initial LaTeX style sheet ([http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/Hermes-Journal_V4_2014.zip](http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/Hermes-Journal_V4_2014.zip)) and for the final acts ([http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/nn_hermes-journal.cls](http://inforsid.fr/Paris2019/docs/nn_hermes-journal.cls)). 

We invite original works, extended abstracts of previously published articles by its authors, literature reviews, position papers, works in progress, negative results and their analysis. It is possible to submit articles in 3 formats:
* **Long articles** of 10-12 pages + bibliographic references
* **Short articles** of 5-6 pages + bibliographical references
* **Extended abstracts** of 2 pages + bibliographic references. Articles based on previously published papers may be accepted in this category; in this case, they will be submitted non-anonymously.

The papers accepted in the INFORSID workshops will be published in the proceedings under the title **"Ateliers d'INFORSID - dessinons ensemble le futur des systèmes d'information"**. 

### The topics targeted are the following (this list is not exhaustive):
* Automated or computer-assisted simplification of science
* Automated or computer-assisted popularization of science
* Automatic synthesis of scientific texts
* Contextualization, search for basic knowledge
* Terminology extraction
* Generation of science journalism articles
* Generation of data journalism articles
* Visualization as a method of simplification
