	abstract = {Considering ways to apply automatic text simplification techniques, I present my day-to-day method for correction-revision of scientific articles in English and explore how these tools could help. The constant need for the definition of new vocabulary emerges as important for a reviser faced with correction of texts on a wide range of specialist subjects, so I examine the ways in which this problem can be approached. While tools aimed at learner readers or for creating texts for general readership from highly technical ones are not an exact fit to the needs of a reviser, they could pave the way to a new workflow. This paper is not an experimental study but rather a first step to asking how these tools could assist in a process I use in my work in correction-revision of scientific papers, how they could help to train a human user or, potentially, themselves.},
