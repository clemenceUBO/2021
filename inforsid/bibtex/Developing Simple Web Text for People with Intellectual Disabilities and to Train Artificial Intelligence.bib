	abstract = {Poor reading comprehension presents significant challenges to people with intellectual disabilities (PwID); the aging; non-native language speakers; and people with low literacy. Text simplification aims to reduce text complexity while retaining its meaning. Text simplification research for PwID has been ongoing for decades. However, until recently, there has been no significant effort to automatically simplify text, specifically for PwID, using artificial intelligence technologies. In the short term, we are working to improve manual text simplification by creating We are working on Web text simplification using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The best way to determine the efficacy of the plain language guidelines we have operationalized is to have text simplified with them judged by expert testers: people with intellectual disabilities.},
