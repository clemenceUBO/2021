## SimpleText-2021: (Re)Telling right scientific stories to non-specialists via text simplification

SimpleText is a new workshop organised as a part of [CLEF-2021 conference](http://clef2021.clef-initiative.eu/), initiated by [CLEF initiative](http://www.clef-initiative.eu/).

News stories judged to be true according to fact-checkers spread more slowly than fake news and reach fewer people. Stories the individuals find credible can determine their behaviour, e.g. response to the pandemic, the application of social distancing, using dangerous fake medical treatments, etc. Fake news plays on people’s emotions, but they are also easier to understand by non-professionals than the research papers. 

Since scientific publications are difficult for people outside the domain and so they do not read them at all even if they are accessible. Popularization of science is one of UNESCO’s oldest programs, but human simplification of scientific documents is expensive and time consuming. Users cannot have an instant, simplified summary on a specific topic they are interested in. 

To put a step forward to resolve this problem we propose a new workshop called SimpleText which aims to create a community interested in generating a simplified summary of scientific documents and to contribute in making the science really open & accessible for everyone. The goal is to generate a simplified abstract of multiple scientific documents based on a given query. In the first year, we plan to run two pilot tasks: 

(1) given a scientific text, provide background information from an external source to help a user to understand it;

(2) given a short scientific text (e.g. abstract), generate its simplified version.

Keywords: 
* Scientific text simplification
* Science popularisation 
* Scientific journalism
* Contextualization
* Background knowledge

The goal of this new workshop is to create a community interested in generating a simplified summary of scientific documents.  

Open science is the growing movement to make science open, which includes much more than open access. Indeed, just focusing on scientific opening the science and results they contain. Scientific publications are difficult to understand for people outside the domain and so it is likely they will not read them at all even if they have access to them.  

The popularization of science and scientific journalism is [one of UNESCO’s oldest programs](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/sti-policy/global-focus/science-popularization/). In scientific journalism, “journalists serve as intermediaries presenting analyses to the public, but they must also provide the public with the means to reproduce their analyses” (Lynch, 2012). Thus, scientific stories include primary sources allowing the reader to verify a document’s information. In contrast to newspapers limited by the size of the page, digital technologies provide essentially unbounded capabilities for hosting primary-source documents. However, human simplification of scientific documents is very expensive and time consuming. Users cannot have an instant, simplified summary on a specific topic they are interested in.

Although few studies have been carried out in the field of automatic text simplification (Shardlow, 2014) (Liu et al., 2018); it still remains a challengeable task, specifically in the multilingual case.

**The goal of this workshop is to create a simplified summary of multiple scientific documents based on a given query which provides the user with an instant simplified summary on a specific topic he/she is interested in or to generate a daily digest for example for ArXiv.**
