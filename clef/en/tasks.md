## SimpleText Pilot Task Guidelines

We invite you to submit both automatic and manual runs! Manual intervention should be reported.

## Access
Please register at the SimpleText@CLEF workshop in order to access the data: [http://clef2021-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/](http://clef2021-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/)  
After registration, you will receive an email with information on how to log in to the data server: [https://guacamole.univ-avignon.fr](https://guacamole.univ-avignon.fr)

### Result submission:
Participants should put their run results into the folder Documents created for their user.

### 2021 DataSet
For this edition we use the Citation Network Dataset: DBLP+Citation, ACM Citation network ([https://www.aminer.org/citation](https://www.aminer.org/citation)). An elastic search index is provided to participants accessible through a GUI API. This Index is adequate to:
* apply basic passage retrieval methods based on vector or language IR models
* generate Latent Dirichlet Allocation models,
* train Graph Neural Networks for citation recommendation as carried out in [https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/) for example,
* apply deep bi directionnal transformers for query expansion.
* and much more â€¦
